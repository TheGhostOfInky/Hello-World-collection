# Hello World collection
A hello world is usually the first program someone writes when learning a new language, this repository contains 3 types of hello world for every language I've dipped my toes into:
- A "simple" hello world that simply prints 1 line
- A hello world infinite loop that prints the words endlessly
- A hello world + incrementing count loop that prints the words and count until the maximum integer has been reached.
